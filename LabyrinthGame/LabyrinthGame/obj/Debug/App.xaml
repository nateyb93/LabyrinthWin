        <x:String x:Key="BeginText">AMAZEBALLS is a puzzle game where players are required to collect colored pickups which are spread out across a movable game board.</x:String>
        <x:String x:Key="ObjectiveText">The goal of AMAZEBALLS is to collect each of your objectives, one at a time, by shifting the board and moving to the spots containing the objective you are currently seeking.</x:String>
        <x:String x:Key="StartGameText">At the beginning of the game, 6 objectives are distributed randomly to each player from 24 possible objectives corresponding to the colored pickups on the board. The first player to move is selected randomly by the app</x:String>
        <x:String x:Key="StartTurnText">Each player's turn begins by placing the free piece into the board at any one of the 12 designated spots. This has the effect of shifting the board at the position the piece was placed at in the direction indicated by the arrow at the location. This cannot be undone, so choose a location for the piece wisely!</x:String>
        <x:String x:Key="EndTurnText">Once the player has placed the free piece into the board and the board has shifted accordingly, the user may move their game piece to any reachable location on the board. TIP: Try to place the free piece somewhere that will cause the board to shift and open up a path to the objective you are currently seeking! Once the player has moved their game piece, the turn is over</x:String>
        <x:String x:Key="WinText">Once a player has collected each of their 6 objectives, they must return to the space they started the game at, highlighted by a colored border surrounding each player's respective starting square. If any player successfully does so, they will be declared the winner and the game will end.</x:String>
        <x:String x:Key="Rule1Text">You must move nefore each turn, even if you do not need to in order to reach your current objective.</x:String>
        <x:String x:Key="Rule2Text">You can't place the free piece directly across from where the previous player placed theirs. In other words, no takebacksies.</x:String>
        <x:String x:Key="Rule3Text">If moving the maze pushes any piece off the board, those pieces are moved to the newly inserted piece. This move does not count as a move during your turn</x:String>
        <x:String x:Key="Rule4Text">Once you have placed the free tile on the board, you can move as far as you want as long as the square you want to reach is reachable by the visible path on the board. You may also choose to remain in your current location.</x:String>
        <x:String x:Key="Rule5Text">Only one objective can be reached at a time. If an objective is reached during your turn, the new one will be revealed during the followiung turn.</x:String>

        <x:String x:Key="AboutGameTitle">AMAZEBALLS</x:String>
        <x:String x:Key="AboutGameText1">AMAZEBALLS was created based on Ravensburger's classic board tame "The aMAZEing Labyrinth".</x:String>
        <x:String x:Key="AboutGameText2">The aMAZEing Labyrinth has spawned a whole line of  Labyrinth games. The game board has a set of tiles fixed solidly onto it; the remaining tiles that make up the labyrinth slide in and out of the rows created by the tiles that are locked in place. One tile always remains outside the labyrinth, and players take turns taking this extra tile and sliding it into a row of the labyrinth, moving all those tiles and pushing one out the other side of the board; this newly removed tile becomes the piece for the next player to add to the maze.</x:String>
        <x:String x:Key="AboutGameText3">Players move around the shifting paths of the labyrinth in a race to collect various treasures. Whoever collects all of their treasures first and returns to their home space wins!</x:String>
        <x:String x:Key="AboutGameText4">The aMAZEING Labyrinth is simple at first glance and an excellent puzzle-solving game for children; it can also be played by adults using more strategy and more of a cutthroat approach.</x:String>
